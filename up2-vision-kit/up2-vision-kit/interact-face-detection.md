# Build your application on laptop and run it on UP²* with Intel System Studio - CMake Project
This tutorial will guide you through how to import existing CMake projects into Intel® System Studio, then run the applications both locally on the host laptop and remotely on the target UP²* board. All the results and outputs from both local and remote application will be shown on host laptop display.

### Import existing CMake Project - Samples(interact-face-detection)
#### 1. Pre-requisites
> :warning: Please make sure you have setup the [Internet Connection Sharing](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/smart-video-workshop/blob/master/up2-vision-kit/dev_machine_setup.md) to get an **IP address** for your UP Squared* AI Vision Kit, it should be a 10.42.0.xxx

Clean up some settings during our preparation of the workshop on Intel® System Studio by running below commands:

	cd /home/<username>/system_studio/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/
	rm -rf org.eclipse.core.*
	rm -rf org.eclipse.debug.*
	cd

#### 2. Prepare the samples project folder to Intel® System Studio workspace
	cd /home/<username>/system_studio/workspace
	mkdir samples
	cp /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/inference_engine/samples/CMakeLists.txt /home/<username>/system_studio/workspace/samples
	cp -r /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/inference_engine/samples/common /home/<username>/system_studio/workspace/samples
	cp -r /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/inference_engine/samples/thirdparty /home/<username>/system_studio/workspace/samples
	cp -r /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/inference_engine/samples/interactive_face_detection_demo /home/<username>/system_studio/workspace/samples
	
#### 3. Create a C++ project named samples in Intel® System Studio
1. Open Intel® System Studio pre-installed on your laptop by double-click the icon on Desktop
2. Go to **Window** -> **Preferences** -> **Intel(R) System Studio** -> **Hide unsupported wizards**, **uncheck** the box, hit Apply then OK

5. Click **Apply** and **Run**, you will see the realtime face detection with age, gender, head pose prediction and mood analysis on the display

### Run interactive_face_detection_sample as remote application on target UP²* but display the processed video on host laptop

Cross compiling may cause issues while host and target system has different type of CPU. In this case, our host laptop has the Intel Core CPU while on the UP²*, it was using Intel Atom CPU. So, we need to set the flags for compiler running on the host, to disable the unsuppoted CPU extensions for the target system. In addition, since we don't connect monitors for UP²* but are going to run a graphic application on it, we will use X forwarding to send back the graphics to show on our host system. 

1. Right click **Build** under the **samples**, click **delete**:
	<br>

	![image of Intel System Studio](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/smart-video-workshop/blob/master/images/ISS_Delete_Build.png "Delete Build")

	<br>
	
2. Right click the project name, at the bottom of the options, select **Properties -> C/C++ Build**, double click **CMake**, then select **Host OS overrides**, on the right panel, click **Add...** of **CMake cache entries to define (-D)**. In the **Add new CMake Define** window, put **ENABLE_AVX2** into Variable name, select **BOOL** as Type, and put **OFF** into Value:
	<br>

	![image of Intel System Studio](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/smart-video-workshop/blob/master/images/ISS_ENABLE_AVX2.png "Add Cmake Option")

	<br>
	
3. click **Add...** of **CMake cache entries to define (-D)**. In the **Add new CMake Define** window, put **ENABLE_AVX512F** into Variable name, select **BOOL** as Type, and put **OFF** into Value, then click **Apply**:
	<br>

	<br>
	
4. Click the little hammer icon on top left to rebuild the project
5. Open a terminal, copy the generated CPU extension library to the target system by typing:

		cd /home/<username>/system_studio/workspace/samples/build/Debug/intel64/Release/
		scp -r lib upsquared@10.42.0.xxx:/home/upsquared/
		
6. To run a graphic application on remote device and display on your host, here we use X11 Forwarding with SSH, open another Terminal on your laptop, type below command and **keep this terminal open**

		ssh upsquared@10.42.0.xxx -X 
	
7. To get the read and write authority of the camera on the remote device, we need to type: 
	
		sudo chmod 666 /dev/video0
		
	> **Note:** upsquared@upsquared-UP-APL01:~$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/video0


8. Back to Intel System Studio interface, right click **interactive_face_detection_sample_demo** from **Binaries**, select **Run As -> Run Configurations...**, then doulbe click **C/C++ Remote Application**, it will generate a configuration named **interactive_face_detection_demo**, rename it to **interactive_face_detection_demo_remote**, click Apply

9. Click **New** button after **Connection:**
	<br>

	<br>	

12. In **Remote Absolute File Path for C/C++ Application**, type:

		/home/upsquared/interactive_face_detection_demo
		
13. In **Commands to execute before application**, type:
	> **Note:** *Remember to open a Terminal on your laptop, type **ssh upsquared@10.42.0.xxx -X** and keep this terminal open, for running a GUI application remotely and display it locally*
	
		export DISPLAY=localhost:10.0
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/upsquared/lib
		source /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/bin/setupvars.sh

6. Click **Arguments** tag, add below arguments in **Program arguments:** then click Apply and OK

		-i cam -m ${ROOT_DIR}/intel_models/face-detection-retail-0004/FP32/face-detection-retail-0004.xml -d CPU -m_ag ${ROOT_DIR}/intel_models/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013/FP32/age-gender-recognition-retail-0013.xml -d_ag CPU -m_hp ${ROOT_DIR}/intel_models/head-pose-estimation-adas-0001/FP16/head-pose-estimation-adas-0001.xml -d_hp GPU -m_em ${ROOT_DIR}/intel_models/emotions-recognition-retail-0003/FP16/emotions-recognition-retail-0003.xml -d_em GPU

Now we can make a comparison of the performance running the same application between on our host laptop and on the UP² AI Vision kit, and you can load different models used here to different hardware by changing the arguments and see what is the optimized configuration for this application.
